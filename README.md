# IE2111-Forecasting-Electricity-Tariffs
Project Dates: February 2020 - April 2020
## Disclaimer
While this project was a collaborative group effort, I want to emphasize that all the Python codes (including the VAR model) are entirely my own work and self-contained. Therefore, no additional codes are required to reproduce the results presented here.

## Overview
Our group project was focused on determining the most suitable electricity plan for residential consumers based on their needs as well as various independent variables that may impact electricity costs. The purpose of the VAR model was to forecast future electricity tariffs, as these predictions could aid in consumer decision-making. The logic behind this was that fixed-price plans would be favoured if tariffs were expected to increase, while discount-off-regulated-tariff plans would be preferred if tariffs were expected to decrease.

I embarked on this project as a means to explore data science and machine learning, driven by my curiosity and desire to learn. It's important to note that this project was one of my earliest forays into Python machine learning, undertaken shortly after my introduction to programming basics in Python through CS1010E. While it may not represent my proudest work, I have chosen to share it as a key milestone in my learning journey. During this project, I spent countless hours independently researching factors affecting electricity prices, exploring various machine learning models, and seeking reliable data sources.

In hindsight, I've come to recognize that machine learning is not a one-size-fits-all solution and may not be suitable for all problems. In this case, the nature of electricity tariffs in Singapore, where the government determines tariffs quarterly, often with little change from the previous quarter, makes them less responsive to the kind of predictive modelling I attempted. Additionally, the challenge of sourcing reliable data without guidance posed its own set of difficulties. As the saying goes, "rubbish in, rubbish out". This project underscores the importance of carefully considering the suitability of machine learning approaches in addressing specific problems, taking into account the nature of the data and the unique characteristics of the domain.
